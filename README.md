**Problem Statement**:
The sales team faces difficulties in accessing real-time sales performance data, leading to delays in decision-making and a lack of clarity on key performance indicators (KPIs). Existing sales reports are static, making it hard to analyze trends, track goals, and detect opportunities for improvement.
