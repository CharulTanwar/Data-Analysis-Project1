In the above dashboard, the total revenue generated in 2017 is $92.88M, and the total sales quantity is 234K units. Additionally, the dashboard allows you to explore the data in more detail by providing a month-wise breakdown and by segmenting revenue according to different market sets.

**Problem Statement**:


The sales team faces difficulties in accessing real-time sales performance data, leading to delays in decision-making and a lack of clarity on key performance indicators (KPIs). Existing sales reports are static, making it hard to analyze trends, track goals, and detect opportunities for improvement.
